# Project Planning
 

### Criteria and Rubric


1. You have a forecast of how many story points your team can complete during this sprint. The forecast along with its rationale are documented in your git’s repo.
10.0 pts

- We forecast that we can complete 4 story points in the first sprint. These stories are as follows:
1
2
3
4
-Our rationale for completing these story points is that these are essential to the foundation of the application before moving on to more complex tasks such as...


2. You decomposed stories into tasks. The tasks are clearly listed in your sprint backlog.
10.0 pts

- Our trello board has each story decomposed into tasks. Each card represents a task that is mapped to a particular story. The completion of all of a stories cards means that all tasks are completed and the story is completed. Completed stories and their respective tasks are backlogged on our board under the "done" category.  
 


3. Your sprint backlog, including both stories and tasks, is represented in a kanbanboard. The kanban board, or a URL of the kanban board (from your online management tool), is documented in your git’s repo. I should be able to view the board.
[Update your sprint backlog task board. Make sure the URL or images are available in your GitHub repo].
15.0 pts

- The link to our board is : https://trello.com/w/workspace57274945


4. You have a sprint burndown chart. On the x-axis, you display time markers in units of 1 day. On the y-axis, you display story points remaining to get done. There is a linear curve descending from left to right; the leftmost point of the curve is number of story points in your sprint at sprint day 1; the rightmost point is 0 story points remaining on the last day of the sprint. The burndown chart, or the URL of the burndown chart (from your online management tool), is documented in your git’s repo. I should be able to view the burndown chart.
[Update your burndown chart. Make sure the URL or images are available in your GitHub repo.]

5. You have conducted multiple Daily Scrums. You have evidence of at least one daily scrum documented in your git’s repo, should cover the following three items:
- What did you do in the last 24 hours that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal? Annotate your team's response so it's clear which team members did which activities.
- What will you do in the next 24 hours to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal? Annotate your team's response so it's clear which team members plan to do which activities.
- Do you see any impediment that prevents you or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal? What are the impediments? What is your impediment removal plan?

6. There is evidence that you paired or mobbed on your code. The evidence could be a photo or video of your team working together, or it could be some other kind of evidence. The evidence is included in your GitHub repo.
15.0 pts


7. There is evidence that you are building your product test-first. There is at least 1 BDD / A-TDD test in your test suite, and it passes. There are at least 10 unit tests in your test suite, and they all pass.
10.0 pts


8. Your team conducts a Sprint Review. There should 
be an evidence to that.
5.0 pts

9. Your product increment is working software—the completed stories in this sprint must be reflected in the application/product (in form of features) and ready to show to your customer. A link to your working prototype should be documented in your git repo.
10.0 pts
